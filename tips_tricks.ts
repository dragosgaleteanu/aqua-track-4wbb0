    "When hand-washing dishes, never run water continuously. Wash dishes in a partially filled sink and then rinse them using the spray attachment on your tap.",
    "If you have an electric dishwasher, use it only to wash full loads, and use the shortest cycle possible. Many dishwashers have a conserver/water-miser cycle.",
    "When washing or shaving, partially fill the sink and use that water rather than running the tap continuously. (This saves about 60% of the water normally used.) Use short bursts of water to clean razors.",
    "Use either low-flow shower heads or adjustable flow-reducer devices on your shower heads. (They reduce flow by at least 25%.)",
    "Wash only full loads in your washing machine.",
    "Use a bowl in the sink when washing fruit and vegetables or dishes. You can then use the waste water to water your plants",
    "Turn off the tap when you clean your teeth. A running tap uses up to nine liters of water a minute.",
    "Using a watering can in the garden instead of a sprinkler or a hosepipe. Garden sprinklers and hosepipes left running can use between 500 and 1,000 liters (about the volume of a large refrigerator) of water an hour.",
    "Think about fitting a water butt to collect rainwater off your roof. Water butts usually store about 200 liters (about twice the volume of a mini fridge) of water. As well as being better for watering your plants, using rainwater in the garden reduces the amount of treated water you use.",
    "Repair leaky toilets. Add 12 drops of food coloring into the tank, and if color appears in the bowl one hour later, your toilet is leaking."
